# AGEL survey plugin for the legacysurvey-viewer

This browser extension marks the strong gravitational lenses measured by the [AGEL survey](https://sites.google.com/view/agelsurvey/home?authuser=0) along with the redshifts published in [our latest data release paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08041).


Download the extension for firefox [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/agel-plugin-for-legacysurvey/) and chrome (coming soon).

### Demo 

All the AGEL survey lenses are marked in green.

Clicking on any given circle will show the AGEL ID along with the measured source and deflector redshifts. 
If there are lenses with multiple arcs, they are denoted by a separate circle. For example, AGEL013442+043350A and AGEL013442+043350B.
